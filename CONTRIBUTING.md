pip install -e .[dev,mcp]
```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended):
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Environment Variables

For testing with LLM functionality, you may need to set:
```bash
export MRRA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export MRRA_API_PROVIDER="openai-compatible"
export MRRA_API_MODEL="your-model"
export MRRA_API_BASE_URL="your-endpoint"
```

## Code Standards

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting:
  ```bash
  ruff check .
  ruff format .
  ```

### Code Quality
- Write clear, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- Aim for good test coverage of core functionality

### Documentation
- Update relevant documentation for any changes
- Include docstrings with examples for public APIs
- Update CHANGELOG.md for notable changes

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**:
   - Follow the code standards above
   - Include tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   ruff check .
   ruff format .
   pytest
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```
   
   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `test:` for test additions
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring

5. **Push to Your Fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the GitHub repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
